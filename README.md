## Data Structures
 
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for 
efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, 
the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
